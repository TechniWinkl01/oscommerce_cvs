The Exchange Project - FAQ
--------------------------

Last Update: 14th August, 2000

q. How can I check the way my PHP was compiled?
a. Call phpinfo() in a script:

   <? phpinfo(); ?>

q. How does the versioning of this project work?
a. Preview Release 1.0 - initial release.
   Preview Release 1.1 - bugfixes and updates.
   Preview Release 2.x - development releases based on CVS - since new functions will be added,
                         the database design will not be compatible with Preview Release 1.x
   Preview Release 3.0 - next stable release, although a long way away, it will be the basis
                         basis of a complete version 1.0 of this project.

q. I am on a Windows machine, how can I extract the download package?
a. WinZIP is able to extract gzip/tar archives. Download it at www.winzip.com

q. Variables are'nt being parsed along pages. Why?
a. Your PHP is not compiled to track variables. Compile PHP with --enable-track-vars

q. The session-ID is screwing up my urls in href links! Why?
a. This is (was?) PHP's fault :P In this project, there is a custom function being called where
   all links are made, called tep_href_link() - this function is used for normal href links,
   forms, and header redirects. The best way to avoid this problem is to use the function as

   <?php echo '<a href="' . tep_href_link('index.php', 'a=b', 'NONSSL') . '">my link</a>'; ?>

q. An error is reported of not being able to write to the parse_time_log file.
a. This file needs to have the correct write permissions for the apache user to be able to write
   to it. If you continue to get this error, create a 0 byte file with the right permissions.
