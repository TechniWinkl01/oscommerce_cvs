This directory contains local configuration information.

It also must contain a file named configure.php that can be used to override
the defaults set in application_top.php

Also it *MUST* end with the following lines:

// This is needed to tell application_top.php that we were read in and OK
  define('CONFIGURE_STATUS_COMPLETED', 1);

Remember to execute PHP commands the file needs to start with <? and end with ?>
