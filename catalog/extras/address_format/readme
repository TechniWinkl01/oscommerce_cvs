Update: If you  already used add_adr_format.sql then run del_adr_format.sql

Once that is done run new_adr_format.sql

-----

This new version stores an ID# in the countries table and that refers to
an address_format table . This will save space since there are only 3-4
popular formats and very likely less than 12 in the world.

These additions will allow each country to have it's own address label format.
This also expands the post code to 10 (enought for USA ZIP+4)

To expand the table for a pre-pr2.0 TEP use new_adr_format.sql

The default is the same format that TEP used, it is updated for USA and Spain.
(and Singapore... others will be updated as requested)

The format string can have any of the following:

$firstname  $lastname  $street  $city $state $postcode (or $zip) $country

Some specials:

$streets   Basically treats $suburb as a $street2 (second line of street address)

if $suburb == '' then $streets = $street
else $streets = $street . $cr . $suburb

$cr either <br> or \n (Html or Text mode)
$hr either <hr> or a series of ---------------------
