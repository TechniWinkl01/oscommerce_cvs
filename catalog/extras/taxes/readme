The taxes are done. The first version anyway.

The standard CVS catalog works with the code.

If you have an older database it can be upgraded with 'add_taxes.sql'
If you want Canada and USA states include "na_zones.sql" in the database.

Until you add a tax_class and tax_rate the tax rate will be TAX_VALUE (as it was before)

To add tax do this:  (these three commands are also in fla_test.sql)

Not that 18 is the tax_zone for USA, Florida

INSERT INTO tax_class VALUES (1, 'Taxable Goods', 'The following types of products are included non-food, services, etc');
INSERT INTO tax_rates VALUES (18, 1, 7.0, 'FL TAX 7.0%');

Set products_tax_class_id to 1 'Taxable Goods'

update products set products_tax_class_id = 1 where products_tax_class_id = '0';

These also assume you have included 'na_zones.sql'

Any questions send mail to tep-dev

There may be bugs, I will fix them!

Oh yea, as of 11/4/00 the admin portion was not done.
