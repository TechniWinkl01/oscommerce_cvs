The Exchange Project Administration Tool Preview Release 2.1 (xx.02.2001)

Quick Installation
------------------

Follow these steps to get the administration running:

Extract the files from within the package

    tar -xzf tep_administration-pr2.1.tar.gz
 
This would have created a directory called 'tep_administration-pr2.1'. Enter
this directory and copy the 'admin' directory to where your WWW root directory
is located

    cd tep_administration-pr2.1
    cp -R admin /usr/local/apache/htdocs/

For this example, '/usr/local/apache/htdocs/' is used as the WWW root
directory of Apache.
 
View the files admin/includes/application_*.php and make necessary changes.

It is up to you how you wish to protect the administration pages
against unauthorized use.
**********************************************************************

For the administration tool to be able to insert and delete images, the
right permissions need to be setup on the images directory. Find out which user
and group the apache process runs under, and execute the following:

cd catalog
chown -R nobody.nobody images
in the above example, the apache process is run by user 'nobody', which belongs
to the group of 'nobody'. For more information on the 'chmod' command, read its
manual:

man chown
