The Exchange Project Administration Tool Preview Release 1.1 (12.06.2000)

Quick Installation
------------------

Follow these steps to get the administration running:

Extract the files from within the package

    tar -xzf tep_administration-pr1.1.tar.gz
 
This would have created a directory called 'tep_administration-pr1.1'. Enter
this directory and copy the 'admin' directory to where your WWW root directory
is located

    cd tep_administration-pr1.1
    cp -R admin /usr/local/apache/htdocs/

For this example, '/usr/local/apache/htdocs/' is used as the WWW root
directory of Apache.
 
View the files admin/includes/application_*.php and make necessary changes.
Changes will also need to be made to admin/includes/functions/database.php for
your database connections.
 
It is up to you on how you wish to protect the administration side against
unauthorized use.

For the administration tool to be able to insert and delete images, the
right permissions need to be setup on the images directory. Find out which user
and group the apache process runs under, and execute the following:

cd catalog
chown -R nobody.nobody images

in the above example, the apache process is run by user 'nobody', which belongs
to the group of 'nobody'. For more information on the 'chmod' command, read its
manual:

man chown

*** NOTE ***

The following changes to the database model needs to be done in order for this
administration tool to work. This little modification adds support for order status.

    mysql catalog
    alter table orders add orders_status varchar(10) not null default 'Pending';
    alter table orders add orders_date_finished varchar(14) null;

An update to the catalog/checkout_process.php page also needs to be made on line 18
to add data to the 'orders' table for the extra columns (orders_status and
orders_date_finished). The following change needs to be made:

[LINE 18]  tep_db_query("insert into orders values ('', '" . $customer_id . "', '" . $customer_name . "', '" . $customer_values['customers_street_address'] . "', '" . $customer_values['customers_suburb'] . "', '" . $customer_values['customers_city'] . "', '" . $customer_values['customers_postcode'] . "', '" . $customer_values['customers_state'] . "', '" . $customer_values['customers_country'] . "', '" . $customer_values['customers_telephone'] . "', '" . $customer_values['customers_email_address'] . "', '" . $delivery_name . "', '" . $delivery_values['street_address'] . "', '" . $delivery_values['suburb'] . "', '" . $delivery_values['city'] . "', '" . $delivery_values['postcode'] . "', '" . $delivery_values['state'] . "', '" . $delivery_values['country'] . "', '" . $HTTP_POST_VARS['payment'] . "', '" . $HTTP_POST_VARS['cc_type'] . "', '" . $HTTP_POST_VARS['cc_owner'] . "', '" . $HTTP_POST_VARS['cc_number'] . "', '" . $HTTP_POST_VARS['cc_expires'] . "', '" . $date_now . "', '" . TAX_VALUE . "', 'Pending', '')");

after TAX_VALUE at the end of the sql query, the following was added for the
new columns..

'Pending', ''

This will be fixed in the CVS.
