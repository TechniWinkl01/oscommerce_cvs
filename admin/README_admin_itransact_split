ADMIN INFO (See separate catalog README)

  This admin module was built to work with the TEP itransact_split payment module.  The purpose
  is to give merchants an easy way to accept credit cards, and also gives merchants a direct link
  to their iTransact Control Panel.

  In addition, I've kept the new column_left.php box generic ("Payment Gateway") so that links to other
  payment gateways can be easily added.
