ADMIN INFO (See separate catalog README)

  This admin module was built to work with the TEP itransact_split payment module.  The purpose
  is to give merchants an easy way to accept credit cards, and also gives merchants a direct link
  to their iTransact Control Panel.

  In addition, I've kept the new column_left.php box generic ("Payment Gateway") so that links to other
  payment gateways can be easily added.

  The install is fairly straightforward.

  1.  Put the files, listed above, in their correct directories.

  *   These next two steps are not required if you do not want the new "gateway" box in admin.  It's nice to have, however.

  2.  In admin/includes/application_top.php - add a filename definition for itransact.php as:
      // TriciaB
      define('FILENAME_GATEWAY_ITRANSACT', 'itransact.php');

  3.  In admin/includes/languages/english.php - define the new boxes as:
      // TriciaB
      // Added a new box called "Payment Gateway" for links to outside resources related to selected gateway.
      // gateway box text in includes/boxes/gateway.php
      define('BOX_HEADING_GATEWAY', 'Payment Gateway');
      define('BOX_GATEWAY_ITRANSACT', 'iTransact.com');
